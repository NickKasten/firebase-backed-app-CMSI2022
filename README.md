# firebase-backed-app-CMSI2022

This project was the 3rd of 4 completed for the LMU CMSI2022: Mobile App Development Class in Spring 2023.

It was completed with classmate **Axel Pestoni**.

The following is from my original project description:


# KASTEN SPELLS BLOG

## The one stop-app for all Wizards and Witches wishing to document their spells!

### We implemented three new additional features to the original BareBonesBlog:

1. **A Search bar**

- Allows all the wizards and witches to find the spells they are looking for!

2. **Deletability**

- Allows all *verified* wizards and witches to remove their unwanted spells

3. **Editability**

- Allows all *verified* wizards and witches to edit and improve their spells!

### Our Production Security Policy

> We took a more basic approach with our Security Policy, 
> setting our rules to allow for reading and writing to all.
> We had difficulty reading the documentation here,
> https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/core-syntax ,
> and thus we kept it as simple as possible for all of the 
> wizards and witches that rely on us. We understand that this
> policy leaves us wide open to attacks that directly contact our
> database, however the app itself is coded to not allow unauthorized
> peoples to edit the spells
